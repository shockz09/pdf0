## Design Guidelines

Follow the Neo-Brutalist design system in `DESIGN.md`:
- Thick 2px black borders
- Bold typography
- Warm cream background (#FAF8F5)
- Tool-specific accent colors
- No rounded corners (or minimal)

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode
- Functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and small
- Client-side only — no server actions

## Pull Request Process
