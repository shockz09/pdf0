# noupload/pdf

**Free, private PDF tools that run entirely in your browser.**

No uploads. No servers. No tracking. Your files never leave your device.

## Why I Made This

I saw many other similar client-side PDF tools which wanted to serve as a privacy-first alternative to [ilovepdf](https://www.ilovepdf.com/) etc, cuz most of the stuff that ilovepdf does can be done client-side and it should be. But the other tools which did this client-side were hastily built and their design and UX weren't thought through properly—it felt weird to use them even though they came up with the concept first.

So I built my own with better design and UX which could actually be used in production as an alternative to ilovepdf for most of the functions, except some. Compression isn't the best because true PDF compression requires re-encoding images and fonts with native libraries that don't run well in browsers—so don't expect massive size reductions on image-heavy PDFs.

I would love if people would contribute and use this.
