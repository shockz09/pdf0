## Why I Made This

I saw many other similar client-side PDF tools which wanted to serve as a privacy-first alternative to [ilovepdf](https://www.ilovepdf.com/) etc, cuz most of the stuff that ilovepdf does can be done client-side and it should be. But the other tools which did this client-side were hastily built and their design and UX weren't thought through properly—it felt weird to use them even though they came up with the concept first.

So I built my own with better design and UX which could actually be used in production as an alternative to ilovepdf for most of the functions, except some. Compression isn't the best because true PDF compression requires re-encoding images and fonts with native libraries that don't run well in browsers—so don't expect massive size reductions on image-heavy PDFs.

After some days of building noupload with just PDF tools, I was randomly researching what more stuff we could do client-side. I figured out that just like we could do most of the PDF manipulation stuff client-side, we could also do the same with images, and audio too—though audio is way heavier because FFmpeg is massive, but it still works. So I built the pages for these with many tools in them. A lot of days were spent figuring out the proper flow of everything, but they both turned out pretty well and became worthy additions to noupload. Hence, noupload became a suite, and then I added QR functionality too for people who want to generate/scan/bulk generate or custom design QR codes etc. I also added Encrypt/Decrypt PDF later after figuring out about qpdf-wasm, it's amazing, allows us to do encryption and decryption client-side with ease.

**Q: Why is there a ⚡ icon, what's its purpose?**

While making this tool, I realised that for tasks like PDF → Images, it feels like friction when I upload a PDF and then still have to click "Convert" to get the images. So I experimented with this new UX where enabling this mode removes one layer of friction—for tasks where it makes sense, it just gets straight to the result without that extra click.

I added this to pages which actually allowed it, because obviously you can't remove this friction everywhere. Like for Images → PDF, we can't know when the user is done uploading all the pages they want, but for PDF → Images, we know there's one PDF uploaded so we can skip straight to converting. Another example is HEIC → JPEG in the image tools—just upload and get your JPEG. Same with Strip Metadata—upload the image and it's done, no need for a useless "Remove Metadata" button click.

This works well because everything is processed client-side anyway, so there's no risk of your file going somewhere by mistake—it never leaves your device.

I would love if people would contribute and use this.
